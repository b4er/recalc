# Backend (Haskell)

The main application for the backend follows the design of the
[Haskell Language Server][hls] (reactor pattern), it is built using a generic
way of handling [JSON-RPC][json-rpc] inspired by Servant's named routes.

At the core of the backend is the recalculation engine based on
[`build`][build][^1]. It is responsible for handling incremental recomputations
and dependency tracking for languages implementing the [`Recalc`][recalc-class]
interface. Its main function is [`recalc`][recalc-fun], used by:

1. The [`Recalc.Repl`][recalc-repl] driver (used for tests)
2. The [`Recalc.Univer`][recalc-univer] driver which provides a convenience
   function [`univerMain`][univer-main]

The latter will run a language server which implements the
[protocol][recalc-protocol] understood by the frontend.

## Packages

- **[`recalc-engine`](./haddock/recalc-engine/index.tml)**:
  The core recalculation engine, includes a (preliminary) implementation for a
  dependency map, the document store (keeping track of files and their sheets).
  It defines the `Recalc` interfaces and provides the [`Fetch`][recalc-fetch]
  monad.

- **[`recalc-server`](./haddock/recalc-server/index.html)**:
  A generic implementation for named handlers (from Servant-like protocol
  definition [^2]) of JSON-RPC for generic running language servers.

- **[`recalc-univer`](./haddock/recalc-server/index.html)**:
  A generic backend implementation for a language server talking to the Univer
  frontend. It deals with dispatching the right operations and implements the
  [`Univer.Protocol`][recalc-protocol].
