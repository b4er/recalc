# Revision history for recalc

## 0.7.9.1 -- 2025-02-27

* Initial version: project skeleton for recalculation engine + test suite
* First implementation: minimal recalculation engine for generic language
  implementation based on "Build systems Ã  la carte". Includes a simple
  example language as part of the test-suite.

  Add [`README.md`](./README.md) and document the project organisation a bit.
* Add Syntax for the term language (simple dependently typed lambda calculus).
* Add support for operators with precedences.
* Prepare TypeScript code generation.
* Add server implementation that is used as backend by the TypeScript frontend.
* Generates type-safe routing for TypeScript from Servant-like named protocols,
  implements a generic server based on the reactor pattern (single thread reads
  JSON-RPC messages and queues new jobs, multiple workers handle jobs).
* Send "ok" from , gracefully terminate when the client disconnects (by eof).
* Add more rpc routes for spreadsheet operations (set value ranges,
  sheet insertion, sheet removal, worksheet order, work sheet name).
* Implement all sheet operations on server side (recompute and sheet operations),
  deal with server-side errors forwards. Hook up a mock language interpreter.
* Add a rough implementation for the Language, fix merging meta data, hook it
  up to the server.
* Adjust project structure and add static builds for building the .vsix
* More tests for Recalc.Semantics and some bugfixes.
* Implement simple cell references (no ranges due to current typing).
* Add route for sheet-defined functions to protocol and implement dummy handler.
* Add literals (Boolean values and integers) to core language, add integral
  tensors.
* Implement value parser for constants and integers, make references refer to
  whole cell-ranges and adapt parser. Implement some test cases and a few
  bugfixes.
* Bugfixes: sheet operations should behave now (the `DocumentStore` was not
  properly updated before), keep the `subUnitId` business with Univer/frontend
  (essentially fixes simple cell references).
* Add errors to documentstore, finish typing for values (match parser).
* Add module `Recalc.Repl` for quickly running single-sheet experiments with
  GHCi.
* Add GitHub pages and documentation, make naming more uniform.
* Extend cell diagnostics (show inferred types at info level), fix bug in Repl.
* Implement tensor types for cell ranges.
* Fix some bugs to catch up with end-to-end tests (cell ranges and cell updates).
